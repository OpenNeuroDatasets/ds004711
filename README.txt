BACKGROUND
This dataset contains magnetic resonance imaging data (N=187) from a sample of healthy human participants between 16 and 81 years of age. The neuroimaging session was conducted as part of a cross-sectional study (AgeRisk) of the developmental trajectories of risk preference, impulsivity, and self-control. The neuroimaging session was conducted as the last of three study sessions, and comprised a structural (T1w) scan, as well as functional scans during completion of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (2 runs) and a delay discounting paradigm. Due to time constraints, the delay discounting task was completed by 178 out of 187 participants. This dataset was collected between 2016 and 2017 at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. The dataset was skull stripped prior to uploading using the FSL Brain Extraction Tool.
